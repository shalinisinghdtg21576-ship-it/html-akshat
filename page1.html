<h2>1.Aditya Swarup-Educator/Mentor</h2>
<p>In my opinion to be the best one need the best,applying this in the field of education i believe children should be given a chance to 
    learn various types of skills so that they can shape their future in the best way they can and maximum output can be generated from them and in this world where competition is growing every second they can survive in this world.

<h2>Ways of effective learning</h2>
1. Active Recall<br />

<p>Test yourself regularly instead of just rereading notes. Actively retrieving information strengthens memory.</p>

<p>Review material at increasing intervals over time. This method helps with long-term retention.
</p>

3. Teach What You Learn<br />

<p>Explaining concepts to someone else (or even to yourself) reinforces understanding.</p>

4. Use Mnemonics<br />

<p>Use memory aids like acronyms, rhymes, or visual associations to remember complex information.</p>

5. Study in Short Sessions<br />

<p>Break study time into manageable 25–30 minute sessions with short breaks in between (Pomodoro Technique).
</p>

6. Set Clear Goals<br />

<p>Define specific, achievable goals for each study session to stay focused and motivated.</p>

7. Practice Past Papers<br />

8. Mind Mapping<br />

<p>Create visual diagrams to connect ideas and concepts, making it easier to see relationships.</p>

9. Use Multiple Resources<br/>

<p>Don't rely solely on textbooks. Use videos, apps, online tutorials, and podcasts to learn in diverse ways.</p>

10. Create a Dedicated Study Space<br />

<p>Study in a quiet, organized environment that’s free from distractions.
</p>

11. Stay Consistent<br />
